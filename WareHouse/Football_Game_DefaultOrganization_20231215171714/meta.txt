Language:
Considering the task at hand, I believe Python might not be the best choice for creating a game with a retro feel. Python is great for many tasks, but when it comes to game development, especially one that requires a retro feel, we might want to consider a language that is more suited for game development.

Unity, a powerful game development engine, uses C# as its primary programming language. C# is a statically typed, multi-paradigm language developed by Microsoft. Unity provides a robust set of libraries for game development, including physics engines, AI, and much more. It also has a great community and a lot of resources available online.

Another option could be JavaScript, using a library like Phaser. Phaser is a free open source HTML5 game framework. It can render via canvas or WebGL and is perfect for any kind of 2D game. Phaser also has a strong community and a lot of tutorials and examples online.

In conclusion, for this task, I would recommend either C# (with Unity) or JavaScript (with Phaser). Both of these options are well-suited for game development and can help us create a fun and engaging American Football game with a retro feel. 

Now, let's make a decision.
