Given the nature of the task, I believe creating an Application would be the most suitable approach. This would allow us to create an interactive, engaging, and fun American Football game with a retro feel, as per the customer's request. We can incorporate elements of strategy, competition, and skill, all within a user-friendly interface. The retro feel can be achieved through the use of pixelated graphics and chiptune music, reminiscent of classic arcade games. 

As an application, the game can be easily accessed and played on various devices, providing a wide reach and convenience for the users. It also allows for potential updates and improvements based on user feedback, ensuring the longevity and success of the product. 

Let's discuss further if there are any other considerations or suggestions.

Considering the task at hand, I propose we use Unity with C# for this project. Unity is a powerful game development engine that provides a rich set of features for game development. It supports 2D and 3D graphics, drag and drop functionality, and scripting through C#. It's also cross-platform, which means we can develop the game once and deploy it on multiple platforms. C# is a popular language for game development because it's easy to learn, yet powerful. It's statically typed, which helps catch errors before the game is run. It also integrates well with Unity, making it a good choice for our project.

We will have the following core classes:

1. Player.cs - This class will handle the player's movement and actions.
2. Ball.cs - This class will handle the football's physics and interactions.
3. GameManager.cs - This class will handle the game's state, including scoring and game over conditions.
4. UIController.cs - This class will handle updating the game's UI, such as the score display.

Let's start with the main GameManager class:

GameManager.cs

```csharp

/*
This is the main GameManager class. It handles the game's state, including scoring and game over conditions.
*/

using UnityEngine;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static GameManager instance;
    public int score;
    public bool gameOver;

    private void Awake()
    {
        if (instance == null)
        {
            instance = this;
        }
    }

    private void Start()
    {
        score = 0;
        gameOver = false;
    }

    public void GameOver()
    {
        gameOver = true;
    }

    public void AddScore(int value)
    {
        score += value;
    }
}

```

Next, we have the Player class:

Player.cs

```csharp

/*
This is the Player class. It handles the player's movement and actions.
*/

using UnityEngine;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;

    private void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveY = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        rb.velocity = new Vector2(moveX * speed, moveY * speed);
    }
}

```

Then, we have the Ball class:

Ball.cs

```csharp

/*
This is the Ball class. It handles the football's physics and interactions.
*/

using UnityEngine;

public class Ball : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;

    private void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
        rb.velocity = Vector2.up * speed;
    }

    private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            GameManager.instance.AddScore(1);
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
}

```

Finally, we have the UIController class:

UIController.cs

```csharp

/*
This is the UIController class. It handles updating the game's UI, such as the score display.
*/

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class UIController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Text scoreText;

    private void Update()
    {
        scoreText.text = "Score: " + GameManager.instance.score;
    }
}

```

This is a very basic implementation of an American Football game. There are many ways to expand on this, such as adding different types of players, more complex scoring, power-ups, etc.

 Sure, I understand the task. We will be using C# and Unity, a powerful game development engine, to create this American Football game with a retro feel. Unity uses C# as its primary scripting language which is perfect for our task. 

We will have the following core classes:

1. Player.cs - This class will handle the player's movement and actions.
2. Ball.cs - This class will handle the football's physics and interactions.
3. GameManager.cs - This class will handle the game's state, including scoring and game over conditions.
4. UIController.cs - This class will handle updating the game's UI, such as the score display.

        {
            instance = this;
        }
    }

    private void Start()
    {
        score = 0;
        gameOver = false;
    }

    public void GameOver()
    {
        gameOver = true;
    }

    public void AddScore(int value)
    {
        score += value;
    }
}

```

Next, we have the Player class:

Player.cs

```csharp

/*

    }

    private void Update()
    {
        float moveX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float moveY = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        rb.velocity = new Vector2(moveX * speed, moveY * speed);
    }
}

```

Then, we have the Ball class:

Ball.cs

```csharp

/*
This is the Ball class. It handles the football's physics and interactions.
*/

using UnityEngine;

public class Ball : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed;
    private Rigidbody2D rb;

    private void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
        rb.velocity = Vector2.up * speed;
    }

    private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
    {
        if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            GameManager.instance.AddScore(1);
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
}

```

Finally, we have the UIController class:

UIController.cs

```csharp

/*
This is the UIController class. It handles updating the game's UI, such as the score display.
*/

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class UIController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Text scoreText;

    private void Update()
    {
        scoreText.text = "Score: " + GameManager.instance.score;
    }
}

```
